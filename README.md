# Repository Manager Server
OpenShopChannel's Repository Manager Server, but in SpringBoot and Java.

This is just a personal experiment, don't expect to see it finished
or in production anytime soon.

## Why are you doing this?
Because, why not?

For real now, because Python is not my strength, and I feel I could make
improvements and maintain the repository much better if it was written in Java.
