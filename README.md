# Repository Manager Server
Repository Manager is Open Shop Channel's new generation repository system, by dhtdht020,
designed for simplicity and ease of use.

This repository contains the server used by the Open Shop Channel to serve its official
Repository Manager repositories. It is written in Python 3 and uses the Flask framework.

It is designed to be easy to set up and self-host, as part of the Open Shop Channel's
future plan to add support for third-party repositories to its official clients, such as the OSCDL,
the website, and the Homebrew Browser. This is currently still in development, and not
yet supported in official clients or designed for third-party use.

It is still in early development, so expect bugs and missing features.

Python 3.10+ is required to run this server.
